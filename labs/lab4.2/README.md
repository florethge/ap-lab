## Ap-lab
## Lab 4.2 - Matrix Multiplication
### Programming language: C

On this a multi-threaded matrix multiplicator with the usage of the `pthreads` library was implemented. You will see the following concurrent programming concepts:

- Multitheading
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Race conditions

#### To Compile:
```c
make
```

#### Run Files:
```c
./multiplier -n [number of buffer with a minimum of 8]
```
